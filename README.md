# Console Monopoly Game

The Console Monopoly Game is a project developed for the Modeling and Analyzing of Software class in LPNU. It is a simplified implementation of the classic board game Monopoly, designed to showcase the usage of various coding patterns.

## Coding Patterns Used

The Console Monopoly Game incorporates the following coding patterns:

- **Singleton**: Utilized to ensure there is only one instance of the game board and other essential components throughout the game.
- **Abstract Factory**: Used to create different types of cards, based on their respective categories.
- **Prototype**: Implemented to create copies of game elements, such as players, to ensure efficient object creation.
- **Decorator**: Applied to enhance the behavior of game elements, such as properties, by adding additional functionality dynamically.
- **Facade**: Utilized to provide a simplified interface for interacting with complex subsystems of the game, making it easier to use.
- **Proxy**: Implemented to provide controlled access to sensitive game elements and restrict certain operations.
- **Strategy**: Used to encapsulate different gameplay strategies for players, allowing them to make different decisions based on the game state.
- **State**: Employed to represent different states of the game, such as "By Hotel," "By House" and "Buy Property."
- **Template Method**: Utilized to define the basic structure and flow of the game, allowing specific steps to be implemented by subclasses.

## Project Scope and Highlights

The Console Monopoly Game project aims to provide a basic implementation of the Monopoly game in a console-based environment. It showcases the usage of several coding patterns, demonstrating how they can be applied to enhance software design and maintainability.

Some highlights of the project include:

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can play the game by taking turns, rolling dice, and making decisions based on the game's current state.
- **Game Logic**: The game implements the core Monopoly game logic, including property acquisition, rent calculation, card effects, and player bankruptcy handling.
- **Pattern Implementation**: Each coding pattern is applied in a meaningful way, addressing specific design and development challenges.
- **Modular Structure**: The project is organized into separate modules, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and promoting code reusability.
- **Documentation and Analysis**: The project includes documentation and analysis of each implemented coding pattern.

## Conclusion

The Console Monopoly Game project demonstrates the practical application of various coding patterns in a software development context. It serves as an educational tool for understanding the benefits and usage scenarios of each pattern.
